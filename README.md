# ScheduledEvent Orchestration
## ✨ Overview

Sometime we need to schedule events/jobs to be carried out in the future at varying times (versus fixed).  This project contains examples of different ways to do this using Spring Boot:
- Using combination of on-premise systems and AWS EventBridge Scheduler
- Using fully-homegrown on-premise systems
